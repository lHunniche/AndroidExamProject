# Android Exam Project
An app that fetches data about amiibos from Web Service calls. The API used is https://www.amiiboapi.com/ . 

Data could be lists of different amiibos based on game series, character etc.

Service to query data in background (Threading - network calls on background thread). 

Adapter and RecyclerView to show the list of amiibos. 

Fragments to support List of items and a item detail screen, which can be used for better tablet viewing. 

External libraries will be used, such as Retrofit 2 for web-service calls, and Glide for image processing.

If time permits, a database holding favorite amiibos and use of content provider to share an amiibo.
